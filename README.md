# PSU_minishell1_2017


Epitech's Minishell1 project in C language. 


This is the first project of an important series of projects to arrive at the end of the year at 42sh.

For this project it's necessary to reproduce a Shell with Linux command management. We had to copy tcsh who is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C.
