# PSU_minishell1_2017


Epitech's Minishell1 project in C language. 


This is the first project of an important series of projects to arrive at the end of the year.

For this project it's necessary to reproduce a Shell with Linux command management. We had to copy [tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh) who is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C.

## Requirements

 * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make//)
 * [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## Compilation

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run make to build the BSQ executable file.

Then you have to execute with a map as argument. You can find a map in the "map" directory.

## Features

* Execute basic commands
* Can manage its own environment
* Builtin commands :
  * builtins
  * cd / chdir
  * echo
  * env [-0] [--null] [-u]
  * printenv
  * pwd
  * setenv
  * unsetenv
